#Here's our answer: we first calculate the amount given the
#principal, interest rate, and time. Then, we calculate the
#difference between it and our goal. If the difference is
#positive, that means the goal was met, so we print the
#corresponding message.
amount = amount = principal * math.e ** (rate * time)
difference = amount - goal
if difference > 0:
    print("You'll exceed your goal by " + str(round(difference, 2)))

#If the difference was negative, then the goal was not met,
#so we print the corresponding message. By putting
#-difference instead of difference, we get rid of the negative
#sign for printing. We could have also written
#-round(difference, 2) and it would have performed the same
#way.
else:
    print("You'll fall short of your goal by " + str(round(-difference, 2)))
